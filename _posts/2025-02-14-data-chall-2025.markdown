In a team of three, I participated in the Kaggle competition **“Human Motion Generation (HMG: Text-to-Motion)”** — a challenging benchmark for generating realistic human motion from text prompts. The competition attracted solutions across diffusion models, autoregressive architectures, and learned priors, with submissions evaluated on motion quality, diversity, and alignment with the text description.

## Goals & Context

- **Task**: Given short text prompts, generate plausible, temporally coherent sequences of 3D human motion.  
- **Evaluation criteria**: A mixture of objective metrics including how realistic the motions are; how well they match the textual description; motion smoothness; and diversity (to reduce mode collapse).  
- **Challenges**: Variable prompt lengths; high variability in dataset motion styles; overfitting to training motion trajectories; temporal consistency across frames; evaluation-time robustness in sampling and postprocessing.

## Approach

Our solution emphasised stable preprocessing, strong text-to-motion conditioning, and ensemble inference.

1. **Data preprocessing & normalization**  
   - Standardised motion representations to reduce variability (e.g. joint coordinate normalisation, frame rate alignment).  
   - Cleaned and filtered noisy motion segments to remove outliers or implausible motions.

2. **Modeling & conditioning**  
   - Built models that condition motion generation on text prompts, ensuring alignment via loss functions or auxiliary alignment metrics.  
   - Focused on temporal consistency: encouraging smooth transitions across frames, minimizing jitter or discontinuities.

3. **Inference-time engineering**  
   - Checked multiple model checkpoints and selected those with optimal validation behavior.  
   - Ensembling multiple generators or pipelines to reduce variance and improve generalisation.  
   - Postprocessing: smoothing trajectories, filtering for physical plausibility, possibly mixing or interpolating between sketches to improve motion quality.

## Results & Achievements

- Our final submission placed **2nd** on the competition’s final leaderboard, validating the strength of our preprocessing, conditioning, and ensemble strategies.  
- We observed that ensembling and checkpoint selection consistently improved our metrics (especially alignment-with-text and motion continuity).  
- Generations showed visibly smoother trajectories and better matching to the text prompts compared to many baseline submissions, especially under diverse styles and prompt lengths.

## Lessons Learned & Future Directions

- Effective text conditioning is crucial. The better the model understands nuance in the prompt (e.g. speed, style), the more aligned the motion output.  
- Temporal consistency is often more challenging than spatial correctness—jitter or abrupt frame-to-frame changes degrade perception even if per-frame accuracy is high.  
- Ensembling helps but adds inference complexity — balancing quality gains with runtime/resource costs is important.  

**Potential next steps**:

- Experiment with more powerful architectures (e.g. transformer-based diffusion models or hybrid autoregressive–diffusion pipelines).  
- Incorporate learned priors or motion style transfer to allow more expressive and varied motion outputs.  
- Use human evaluation or perceptual studies to complement automatic metrics.  
- Optimise for real-time or interactive generation (for example, interactive correction or refinement given user input).
