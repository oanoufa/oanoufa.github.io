I completed a data science internship at Volvo Group as part of the first year of my Master's degree in Data Science.

## Role & Context

- Position: Data Science Intern
- Host: Volvo Group - Renault Trucks
- Period: April - July 2024

The internship combined applied data engineering, modelling and evaluation work in an industrial setting. My work aimed to deliver a reproducible pipeline and a clear set of deliverables that the host team could use after the internship.

## Objectives

- Understand the business and technical context at Volvo and define measurable goals.
- Build a data pipeline to extract, clean and aggregate the relevant signals.
- Prototype and evaluate models addressing the defined problem, with clear evaluation metrics and validation protocols.
- Deliver code artefacts and a final presentation to the host team.

## Methods & Tools

The internship used a standard data-science workflow with reproducible code and experiments. Tools and libraries used include:

- Python (data manipulation with `pandas`, experiments with `scikit-learn` / `tensorflow` where relevant)
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- Git for version control
- Conda/`environment.yml` for environment management
- Basic data engineering (CSV/Parquet handling, lightweight ETL)
- Spatial data: handled 3D coordinates (lat, lon, alt) and performed H3 hexagonal aggregation with `geopandas`/`h3` for scalable spatial analysis.


## Outcomes & Deliverables

-- Reproducible code and notebooks for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation.
-- A set of recommendations and next steps for the host team to continue development or productionise the solution.

Quantitative results (metrics, ablation studies, or dashboards) are documented in the internship notebooks and code artefacts.

## Lessons & Next Steps

- The internship strengthened skills in data engineering for applied problems, experiment tracking and communicating technical results to non-technical stakeholders.
- Recommended next steps include automating the data pipeline, extended evaluation on production data and exploring model deployment options.
